Explanatory Notes

K10

What is the K10 and how is it scored?

The K10 is widely recommended as a simple measure of psychological distress and as a measure
of outcomes following treatment for common mental health disorders. The K10 is in the public
domain and is promoted on the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression website
(www.crufad.org) as a self report measure to identify need for treatment.

The K10 uses a five value response option for each question – all of the time, most of the time,
some of the time, a little of the time and none of the time which can be scored from five through to
one.

The maximum score is 50 indicating severe distress, the minimum score is 10 indicating no
distress.

Questions 3 and 6 are not asked if the preceding question was ‘none of the time’ in which case
questions 3 and 6 would automatically receive a score of one.
