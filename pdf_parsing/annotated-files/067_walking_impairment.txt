The Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Walking Impairment Questionnaire 

Overview: Regensteiner et al developed a questionnaire for evaluating walking impairment in patients 
with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This can be used to identify patients with significant impairment 
and to monitor effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The authors are from the Universities of 
Colorado and Rochester. 

Parameters: 

(1) difficulty walking a distance during the past month 

(2) difficulty walking at a certain speed during the past month 

(3) symptoms associated with walking impairment

walking distance score = 

= (20 * (points for walking indoors)) + (50 * (points for walking 50 feet)) + (150 * (points for walking 150 
feet)) + (300 * (points for walking 300 feet)) + (600 * (points for walking 600 feet)) + (900 * (points for 
walking 900 feet)) + (1500 * (points for walking 1500 feet))  

where: each distance is walked is used as a weighting factor for the points from the degree of 
difficulty. 

fraction of maximal walking distance score = (walking distance score) / 6060  

Walking Speed Degree of Difficulty Points 

<q>walking 1 block slowly? (about 1.5 mph)</q> <o>no</o> 3 

  <o>some</o> 2 

  <o>much</o> 1 

  <o>did not do</o> 0 

<q>walking 1 block at an average speed? (about 
2.0 mph)</q> 

<o>no</o> 3 

  <o>some</o> 2 

  <o>much</o> 1 

  <o>did not do</o> 0 

<q>walking 1 block quickly? (about 3.0 mph)</q> <o>no</o> 3 

  <o>some</o> 2 

  <o>much</o> 1 

  <o>did not do</o> 0 

<q>running or jogging 1 block? (about 5.0 mph)</q> <o>no</o> 3 



  <o>some</o> 2 

  <o>much</o> 1 

  <o>did not do</o> 0 

walking speed score = (1.5 * (points for walking slowly)) + (2 * (points for walking at average speed)) + 
(3 * (points for walking quickly)) + (5 * (points for running or jogging))  

where: each speed is walked is used as a weighting factor for the points from the degree of difficulty. 

fraction of maximal walking speed score = (walking speed score) / 34.5

where: 

• A total symptom score was not calculated. This was the questions "were not a ranked 
series." 

• The data was presented as "a percentage of the maximal score possible of 4.0." 

Interpretation: 

• minimum walking distance score: 0 

• maximum walking distance score: 34.5 

• minimum walking speed score: 0 

• maximum walking speed score: 6 60  

• The score can be used to compare impairment before and after vascular surgery. 

Performance: 

• Changes in questionnaire scores correlated with some measurements of treadmill 
performance. 

• Retesting in an untreated control group showed similar scores after 12 weeks.
