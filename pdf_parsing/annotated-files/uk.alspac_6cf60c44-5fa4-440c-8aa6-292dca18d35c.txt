This questionnaire asks about how you have been since the birth of the
baby. It asks how you are feeling, whether you are getting enough sleep
and how you reacted to the actual birth.

All the answers you give are confidential. Your name and address will
not be on the questionnaire.

We would be grateful if you would help us by answering as many of these
questions as possible but if there is any question you do not want to
answer that is fine. Just leave it blank.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP

 FILLING IN THIS BOOKLET

Most of the questions can be answered by ticking the box beside the right answer.

For example

How many times have you been to the supermarket in the past week?

 None 1 1√ 2 2-6 3 7 or more 4

 This means you went to the supermarket once in the past week

Sometimes there are questions with if in front of them.

For example

a) Have you been to the supermarket today?

Yes 1 No√  2

This means you didn't go to the supermarket and you don't
 need to answer the next question

b) If yes, did you buy any carrots?

Yes 1 No 2

In general, though, each question needs an answer.

In some questions you may be asked to describe something.
It would be helpful if you wrote as clearly as possible.

The small numbers in the squares are for office use only.
