Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
 
The rating should be based on a clinical interview moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms 
to more detailed ones which allow a precise rating of severity. The rater must decide whether the rating lies 
on the defined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1,3,5). 
 
It is important to remember that it is only on rare occasions that a depressed patient is encountered who 
cannot be rated on the items in the scale. If definite answers cannot be elicited from the patient all relevant 
clues as well as information from other sources should be used as a basis for the rating in line with 
customary clinical practice. 
 
The scale may be used for any time interval between ratings, be it weekly or otherwise but this must be 
recorded.
