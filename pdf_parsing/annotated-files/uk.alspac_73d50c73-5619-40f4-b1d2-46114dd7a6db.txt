6.12.01 

There are important changes to a boy’s body that can happen
as early as 6 or as late as 20. 
 
At this time in life we have some questions we need to ask 
and which we would appreciate hearing about. 

 
This questionnaire can be filled in by either parent or son. 
 
As always, if you don’t want to answer a question, put a line
through it. 
 
Your answers will of course be kept in confidence 
and not attached to your name. 
 
If you can only answer some of the questions please send
those back.

A1. <q>What is your son’s height (without shoes)?</q> 
 The best way to measure height is to ask your son to stand barefoot as straight  

as possible against a wall, to make a mark on the wall at the highest point on  
the child’s head, and to measure the distance from the mark to the floor. 

 
 
  feet  inches  OR  metres  centimetres

       PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 

 
 

We would like to assess the stage of your son’s physical development using the 
drawings on the next pages. These indicate various stages of puberty commonly used 
by doctors to assess the growth and development of boys. 
 

We need to know which drawings most closely match  
your son’s stage of development at the moment. 

 
Not all children follow the same pattern of development. 

Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both 
the picture and the description. 

 
<q>If there are any additional comments about your son’s physical growth and 
development that you would like to make, then please do so here:</q>
