Introduction 
Clinical studies are significant investments. They are a major source of information for 
go/no-go decisions, regulatory approval, health economics and outcomes research, 
policy determinations, and ultimately patient access and public health benefits. 
Unfortunately, too few clinical studies provide meaningfully robust answers to the 
questions being addressed1. Inadequate planning of trial design, analysis and 
communication can lead to erroneous or meaningless results – deemed “uninformative” 
by some. “Uninformativeness” is detrimental to the research field because it wastes 
scarce resources, risks rejecting medicines or strategies that could have impact, and 
can erode trust between investigators and participants2. 

In contrast, “informativeness is a characterization of a clinical trial that indicates the 
study will achieve its recruitment, statistical power, and other design goals, resulting in 
credibly answering its research questions”3. 

Designing and implementing informative clinical studies requires a team of qualified 
specialists. Frequently this includes, but is not limited to, principal investigators, experts 
in the given disease, clinicians, biostatisticians, pharmacologists, pharmacometricians 
(where the intervention is a drug or requires a dose and regimen selection), and locally 
based operational experts. 

The mission of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s (BMGF’s) Design, Analyze, 
Communicate (DAC) Program is to improve the informativeness of BMGF-funded global 
health clinical studies by performing scientific design reviews, also called “DAC 
Reviews.”  DAC Reviews are conducted by teams of BMGF-funded clinical trial experts 
in the areas listed above.  The review approach prioritizes an overall assessment of trial 
informativeness, as defined by 16 validated research methods for informative clinical 
trial planning, or “best practices” (see Table 1 below).  In addition, the review approach  
evaluates studies for other key critical factors.  BMGF grantees that go through a DAC 
Review receive written feedback about their study planning that they can use to help 
finalize their trial protocol and other key study documents.  

About this document 
The DAC Assessment Tool (DAT) document is a questionnaire developed by the BMGF 
DAC team and filled out by grantees that go through the DAC review process.  Besides 
serving as a key document for DAC reviews, the DAT questionnaire can also be used 
more broadly by Principal Investigators and their teams as a guide for informative 
clinical study planning.

The DAT is divided into three sections of clinical study planning topics: general, design, 
analyze, and communicate. The DAT questions that focus on study planning details 
related to one or more of the 16 best practices for study informativeness are noted with 
a number in brackets that corresponds to the specific best practice(s) as listed in Table 
1 (please note, there are DAT questions below that cite no, one or multiple best 
practices).

Table 1. Best practice research methods for informative clinical trial planning 

DAC Best Practices (BP) Definitions 

1. Prioritize disease burden and 
epidemiology as criteria for study site 
selection 

9. Design interim analyses with decision rules for 
stopping for success or futility early enough to reduce 
the number of participants subjected to ineffective 
interventions 

2. Use accepted and validated endpoints 
whenever possible 

10. When appropriate, use model-informed drug 
development, such as PK/PD modeling 

3. Proactively map study outcome to 
immediate or ultimate policy impact 

11. Adhere to appropriate standards of randomization, 
blinding, allocation concealment, and reducing bias 

4. Rigorously justify effect estimates and 
prevalence assumptions 

12. Use staff with experience in the therapeutic area 
being studied 

5. Simulate trial to ensure right sample 
size and optimal design 

13. Implement a real-time data analysis capability, 
toward improved monitoring of recruitment targets, 
data quality, and other metrics 

6. When feasible and relevant, apply 
adaptive, pragmatic, platform, or other 
innovative clinical trial designs 

14. Engage local regulators, ethics committees and 
policymakers before, during, and after the study, for 
input on design, obtaining relevant approvals, and 
action at study's end 

7. Analyze real world evidence to optimize 
study investments, objectives, and 
feasibility 

15. Implement a communication plan and informed 
consent that involves participants, families, 
communities, and health systems 

8. Prior to study initiation, complete a 
prospective, fixed statistical analysis plan 

16. Publish protocol, analysis plan, and study results, 
including raw study data and code, in an open access 
resource, regardless of study outcome
