Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist 
Instructions 

 
The questions on the back page are designed to stimulate dialogue between you and your patients and to help 
confirm if they may be suffering from the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
 
Description:  The Symptom Checklist is an instrument consisting of the eighteen DSM-IV-TR criteria.  
Six of the eighteen questions were found to be the most predictive of symptoms consistent with 
ADHD.  These six questions are the basis for the ASRS v1.1 Screener and are also Part A of the 
Symptom Checklist.  Part B of the Symptom Checklist contains the remaining twelve questions. 
 
Instructions: 
 

Symptoms 
 

1. Ask the patient to complete both Part A and Part B of the Symptom Checklist by marking an X 
in the box that most closely represents the frequency of occurrence of each of the symptoms. 

 
 

2. Score Part A.  If four or more marks appear in the darkly shaded boxes within Part A then the 
patient has symptoms highly consistent with ADHD in adults and further investigation is 
warranted.  

 
 

3. The frequency scores on Part B provide additional cues and can serve as further probes into the 
patient’s symptoms.  Pay particular attention to marks appearing in the dark shaded boxes.  The 
frequency-based response is more sensitive with certain questions.  No total score or diagnostic 
likelihood is utilized for the twelve questions. It has been found that the six questions in Part A 
are the most predictive of the disorder and are best for use as a screening instrument. 

 
Impairments 

 
1. Review the entire Symptom Checklist with your patients and evaluate the level of impairment 

associated with the symptom.   
 
 

2. Consider work/school, social and family settings.   
 
 

3. Symptom frequency is often associated with symptom severity, therefore the Symptom 
Checklist may also aid in the assessment of impairments.  If your patients have frequent 
symptoms, you may want to ask them to describe how these problems have affected the ability 
to work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people such as their 
spouse/significant other.   

 
History 
 
1. Assess the presence of these symptoms or similar symptoms in childhood.  Adults who have 

ADHD need not have been formally diagnosed in childhood.  In evaluating a patient’s history, 
look for evidence of early-appearing and long-standing problems with attention or self-control.  
Some significant symptoms should have been present in childhood, but full symptomology is not 
necessary.

The Value of Screening for Adults With ADHD 
 

 
 
Research suggests that the symptoms of ADHD can persist into adulthood, having a significant 
impact on the relationships, careers, and even the personal safety of your patients who may 
suffer from it.1-4 Because this disorder is often misunderstood, many people who have it do not 
receive appropriate treatment and, as a result, may never reach their full potential. Part of the 
problem is that it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in adults.  
 
The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist was developed 
in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Workgroup on Adult 
ADHD that included the following team of psychiatrists and researchers: 
 

•  Lenard Adler, MD  
Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology 
New York University Medical School 
 

•  Ronald C. Kessler, PhD 
Professor, Department of Health Care Policy  
Harvard Medical School 
 

•  Thomas Spencer, MD 
Associate Professor of Psychiatry 
Harvard Medical School 
  

As a healthcare professional, you can use the ASRS v1.1 as a tool to help screen for ADHD in 
adult patients. Insights gained through this screening may suggest the need for a more in-depth 
clinician interview. The questions in the ASRS v1.1 are consistent with DSM-IV criteria and 
address the manifestations of ADHD symptoms in adults. Content of the questionnaire also 
reflects the importance that DSM-IV places on symptoms, impairments, and history for a correct 
diagnosis.4 
 
The checklist takes about 5 minutes to complete and can provide information that is critical  
to supplement the diagnostic process.
