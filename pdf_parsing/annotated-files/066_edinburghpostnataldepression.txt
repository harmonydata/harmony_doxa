* If you scored a 1, 2 or 3 on question 10, PLEASE CALL YOUR
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER (OB/Gyn, family doctor or nurse-
midwife) OR GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM NOW to ensure your
own safety and that of your baby.

If your total score is 11 or more, you could be experiencing
postpartum depression (PPD) or anxiety. PLEASE CALL YOUR
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER (OB/Gyn, family doctor or nurse-
midwife) now to keep you and your baby safe.  

If your total score is 9-10, we suggest you repeat this test in one
week or call your health care provider (OB/Gyn, family doctor or
nurse-midwife). 

If your total score is 1-8, new mothers often have mood swings
that make them cry or get angry easily. Your feelings may be
normal. However, if they worsen or continue for more than a week
or two, call your health care provider (OB/Gyn, family doctor or
nurse-midwife). Being a mother can be a new and stressful
experience. Take care of yourself by:
� Getting sleep—nap when the baby naps.
� Asking friends and family for help.
� Drinking plenty of fluids.
� Eating a good diet.
� Getting exercise, even if it’s just walking outside. 

Regardless of your score, if you have concerns about depression
or anxiety, please contact your health care provider.
Please note: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a screening tool
that does not diagnose postpartum depression (PPD) or anxiety.

ABOUT THE EPDS

Studies show that postpartum depression (PPD) affects

at least 10 percent of women and that many depressed

mothers do not get proper treatment. These mothers

might cope with their baby and with household tasks, but

their enjoyment of life is seriously affected, and it is

possible that there are long term effects on the family.

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was

developed to assist health professionals in detecting

mothers suffering from PPD; a distressing disorder more

prolonged than the “blues” (which can occur in the first

week after delivery).

The scale consists of 10 short statements. A mother

checks off one of four possible answers that is closest to

how she has felt during the past week. Most mothers

easily complete the scale in less than five minutes.

Responses are scored 0, 1, 2 and 3 based on the

seriousness of the symptom. Items 3, 5 to 10 are reverse

scored (i.e., 3, 2, 1, and 0). The total score is found by

adding together the scores for each of the 10 items. 

Mothers scoring above 12 or 13 are likely to be

suffering from depression and should seek medical

attention. A careful clinical evaluation by a health care

professional is needed to confirm a diagnosis and

establish a treatment plan. The scale indicates how the

mother felt during the previous week, and it may be useful

to repeat the scale after two weeks. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS

1. The mother checks off the response that comes closest

to how she has felt during the previous seven days.

2. All 10 items must be completed.

3. Care should be taken to avoid the possibility of the

mother discussing her answers with others.

4. The mother should complete the scale herself, unless

she has limited English or reading difficulties.

5. The scale can be used at six to eight weeks after birth

or during pregnancy.

ABOUT THE EPDS

Response categories are scored 0, 1, 2 and 3

according to increased severity of the symptom. Items 3,

5-10 are reverse scored (i.e., 3, 2, 1, and 0). The total

score is calculated by adding together the scores for each

of the ten items. Users may reproduce the scale without

further permission providing they respect copyright (which

remains with the British Journal of Psychiatry) quoting the

names of the authors, the title and the source of the

paper in all reproduced copies.

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was

developed to assist primary care health professionals in

detecting mothers suffering from postpartum depression

(PPD); a distressing disorder more prolonged than the

“blues” (which occur in the first week after delivery), but

less severe than puerperal psychosis.

Previous studies have shown that PPD affects at least

10 percent of women and that many depressed mothers

remain untreated. These mothers may cope with their

baby and with household tasks, but their enjoyment of life

is seriously affected and it is possible that there are long

term effects on the family.

The EPDS was developed at health centers in

Livingston and Edinburgh. It consists of 10 short

statements. The mother underlines which of the four

possible responses is closest to how she has been

feeling during the past week. Most mothers complete the

scale without difficulty in less than five minutes.

The validation study showed that mothers who scored

above a threshold 12/13 were likely to be suffering from a

depressive illness of varying severity. Nevertheless, the

EPDS score should not override clinical judgement. A

careful clinical assessment should be carried out to

confirm the diagnosis. The scale indicates how the mother

felt during the previous week, and in doubtful cases it may

be usefully repeated after two weeks. The scale will not

detect mothers with anxiety neuroses, phobias or

personality disorders.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS

1. The mother is asked to underline the response that

comes closest to how she has felt during the previous

seven days.

2. All 10 items must be completed.

3. Care should be taken to avoid the possibility of the

mother discussing her answers with others.

4. The mother should complete the scale herself, unless

she has limited English or has difficulty with reading.

5. The EPDS may be used at six to eight weeks to screen

postnatal women or during pregnancy. The child health

clinic, postpartum check-up or a home visit may provide

suitable opportunities for its completion.
