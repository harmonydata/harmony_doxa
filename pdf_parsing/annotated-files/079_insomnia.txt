Insomnia Severity Index 
 

 

The Insomnia Severity Index has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score. When you have 

your total score, look at the 'Guidelines for Scoring/Interpretation' below to see where your sleep difficulty fits.  

 

For each question, please CIRCLE the number that best describes your answer.  
 
Please rate the CURRENT (i.e. LAST 2 WEEKS) SEVERITY of your insomnia problem(s).
