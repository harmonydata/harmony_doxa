<q>When you think of the past 12 months, have you bet more than you could 
really afford to lose?</q> 

This self-assessment is based on the Canadian Problem Gambling Index. 
It will help you decide if you wish to seek other forms of support or information. 

<q>When you gambled, did you go back another day to try to win back the 
money you lost?</q> 

<q>Have you borrowed money or sold anything to get money to gamble?</q> 

<q>Have you felt that you might have a problem with gambling?</q> 

<q>Has gambling caused you any health problems, including stress or anxiety?</q> 

<q>Still thinking about the last 12 months, have you needed to gamble with 
larger amounts of money to get the same feeling of excitement?</q>

<q>Have people criticized your betting or told you that you had a gambling 
problem, regardless of whether or not you thought it was true?</q> 

<q>Has your gambling caused any financial problems for you or your household?</q> 

<q>Have you felt guilty about the way you gamble or what happens when you gamble?</q>
