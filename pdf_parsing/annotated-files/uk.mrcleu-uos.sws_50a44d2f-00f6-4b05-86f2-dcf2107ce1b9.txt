Robert Goodman, 1997 

 
For each item, please circle the appropriate number for "Not True", "Somewhat True" or 
"Certainly True".    It would help us if you answered all items as best you can even if you are not 
absolutely certain, or the items seem daft!   

Please give your answers on the basis of the child's behaviour over the last six months.
