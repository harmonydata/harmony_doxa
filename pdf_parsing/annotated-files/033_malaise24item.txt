Further information on the Malaise Inventory

The Malaise Inventory is comprised of 24 self-completion items covering emotional and somatic

symptoms and is intended to measure psychological distress (Rutter, 1970). The Malaise Inventory

was derived from the Cornell Medical Index Health Questionnaire, which was comprised of 195 self-

completion items (Brodman et al., 1949). Each item in the Malaise Inventory has the response

options yes or no.

different population groups (Rodgers et al., 1999). Consequently it has been widely used in

population studies.
