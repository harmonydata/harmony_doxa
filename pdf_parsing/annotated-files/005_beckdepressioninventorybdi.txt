INTERPRETING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY 

Now that you have completed the questionnaire, add up the score for each of the twenty-one 
questions by counting the number to the right of each question you marked. The highest possible 
total for the whole test would be sixty-three. This would mean you circled number three on all 
twenty-one questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the lowest 
possible score for the test would be zero. This would mean you circles zero on each question. 
You can evaluate your depression according to the Table below. 

Total Score____________________Levels of Depression 

1-10____________________These ups and downs are considered normal  
11-16___________________ Mild mood disturbance  
17-20___________________Borderline clinical depression  
21-30___________________Moderate depression  
31-40___________________Severe depression  
over 40__________________Extreme depression
