 The Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ) was adapted from the 

Physiological Reactions Questionnaire developed by Derryberry and Rothbart (1988).  

Based upon the results from recent studies (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000; Evans & 

Rothbart, 2007) we have formulated a self-report model of temperament that includes 

general constructs of effortful control, negative affect (which can be further divided into 

aggressive and nonaggressive negative affects) extraversion/surgency, orienting 

sensitivity, and affiliativeness.

Scoring Instructions for Evans & Rothbart (2007) ATQ long form  

Reversed (R) Items:  After the initial coding of the questionnaire, reversed items 

need to be reverse coded (i.e., a response of 1=7, 2=6, 3=5, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, and 7=1). 

Items that are reversed are marked with an “R” next to their item number in the listing of 

items by scale.   

Subscales/Subconstructs are listed in bold print.  To score the subscales, add all 

of the Likert-responses within a given scale together and divide by the number of valid 

item responses.   

General Scales/Constructs are listed in capitalized, underlined print.  To score 

general scales for the long form, add the AVERAGE Likert score from each subscale and 

then divide by the total number of items belonging to that scale.   

Item clusters are used to further differentiate the content of subscales and are 

listed in italics.  Not all of the main-scales are divided into item clusters.  If particular 

item clusters are of interest, they can be scored in the same manner as the subscales.  

However, in most instances, it is likely that the main scales and/or factor scales will be 

the variables of interest.
