This questionnaire is for the mother, or person taking the place of the mother.

Some questions are the same as those you have answered before.  This is so that we can tell
what changes have happened to you. Others are new - we hope you will enjoy them.  To answer
simply tick the box which is most accurate in your opinion.

Please answer all questions if you can, even if they are similar.  If you do not want to answer
a question or if it does not apply to you, put a line through it.  There are no good or bad answers.
Just tell us what you really think.

All answers are confidential

          THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
