Stroke Impact Scale 
VERSION 3.0 

 
 
The purpose of this questionnaire is to evaluate how 
stroke has impacted your health and life.  We want to 
know from YOUR POINT OF VIEW how stroke has 
affected you.  We will ask you questions about 
impairments and disabilities caused by your stroke, as 
well as how stroke has affected your quality of life.  
Finally, we will ask you to rate how much you think you 
have recovered from your stroke.
