About the Child of the New Century...

The Child of the New Century is exploring what it is like to grow up in the 21st century by following
around 19,000 children born in the UK in 2000/2001, and their families. Your 5-year old brother or sister
is one of the children included in this study. He or she has been asked to do some measurements with
the interviewer, who has also talked to your parents. We are also interested in you. We’d like to
complete the picture of your family by asking you some questions of your own. These are designed for
people aged 10-15 which is why you have been asked to do this. If there are more than two 10-15 year
olds in your family, you have been selected by chance by the computer.

You may have filled in a booklet like this last time we visited your family. Although the questions are
pretty much the same, we are asking you to answer them again so that we can learn how your life has
changed over two years. If you didn’t answer them before we are still very interested in what you are
able to tell us.

Tell me about yourself...
Please tell us about yourself by answering the questions in this booklet. The questions are about things
that happen at school, at home and at other times, your health and your views about the area where
you live. Your answers will help us to learn more about the kinds of things that people your age do and
what you think about your life.

We are interested in your honest answers and we will not tell anyone what your answers are in a way
that would identify you. The questions should take about 10-15 minutes to answer and you can answer
them at a time that suits you.

Your parent has given the interviewer permission to give this questionnaire to you, but it is completely
up to you whether or not you answer the questions in this booklet. If you do want to, please read the
instructions over the page which tell you what to do. You can miss out any question that you don’t want
to or can’t answer. If you don’t want to answer any of the questions, then you can give the questionnaire
back to the interviewer, post it back in the envelope provided, or simply throw it away.

If you have any questions about the study or the questions in the booklet, please ask the interviewer,
your parent or call the study team on Freephone 0800 783 5890.

Thank you very much for reading this.
