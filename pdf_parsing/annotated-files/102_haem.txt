HAEM-A- QOL 
 

Questionnaire for Adults 
 
Dear Patient! 
 
We would like to know how you have been feeling during the past weeks. Please be so 

kind as to answer the following questions in this questionnaire, which was composed 

specifically for people with haemophilia.  

To answer the following questions we would like to ask you to observe the instructions 

below: 

 Please read each question carefully. 

 Think about how things have been for you over the past weeks. 

 Mark (x) the box corresponding to the answer that fits you best, using a 

cross mark  

 Only make one cross for each question  

 There aren’t right or wrong answers 

 What you think is important 

 There are some aspects, which might not concern you (Sport & Leisure, 

Family Planning, Work & School, e.g. if you don’t work or don’t go to school). 

Please mark in this case the answer category “not applicable”. 

 
All your answers will be treated with the strictest confidence! 

 
Date of completion: __ / __ / __ (day / month / year)
