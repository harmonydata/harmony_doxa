2: ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE 
 Now I’m going to ask you about your activity and exercise patterns over the last three 

months.  We would like you to divide up a “typical” day into three types of activity. 

These are: 

  (1) sleeping or lying,   (2) sitting, (3) standing or walking. 

 

 

2.1 <q>Over a typical 24 hour day how many hours do you 

 generally spend sleeping or lying with your feet up?</q>                 hrs       mins    

  

 (ask time usually go to bed & wake up, including any at work!) 

 

 This would indicate xx hours sitting or on your feet. 

 

 

2.2 <q>Of those hours how many on a typical day do you spend sitting  

down?  (e.g. includes sitting at work, mealtimes, 

 driving, reading, watching TV)</q>                                                                               

                        hrs      mins 

 

                                                                                               

2.3 <q>This would mean that you spend about xx hours a day on your feet.  Does this sound 

about right?</q> 

                                                                                                                    hrs                mins    

            

   

   



 
 

3 
 

 
  

2.4 <q>Out of these xx hours spent on your feet, about how much of the time are you actively  

 on the move (rather than standing fairly still)?</q> 

*  1. <o>Very little 10%</o> 

  2. <o>Some  30%</o> 

  3. <o>About half 50%</o> 

  4. <o>Most  70%</o> 

  5. <o>Almost all 90%</o> 

 

2.5 During the past three months, how often have you done the following kinds of 

 * exercise or activities? 

 

a)  <q>strenuous exercise which normally makes your heart beat rapidly AND leaves you 

breathless e.g. jogging, vigorous swimming or cycling, aerobics.</q>

 <q>and on average about how long does                 

 each period of activity last?</q>            hrs            mins 

 

b) <q>moderate exercise which normally leaves you exhausted but not breathless, e.g. brisk 

walking, dancing, easy swimming or cycling, badminton, sailing.</q>

c) <q>gentle exercise  which normally leaves you tired but not exhausted, e.g. walking,

3:  DIETARY QUESTIONS 
 

3.1 Now I am going to ask you about the foods you eat. To do this I have a list of foods and I would like you to tell me how often you have eaten each food 

during the past 3 months.  The list may include foods you never eat or you may find foods which you eat a lot are missing.  These can be added on at the 

end. (Define the 3 month period)
