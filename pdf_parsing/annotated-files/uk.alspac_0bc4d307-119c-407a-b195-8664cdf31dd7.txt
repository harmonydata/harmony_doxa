MY    DAUGHTER

   This questionnaire asks about your baby. We are interested to know about
her health and behaviour. We also ask about you and your baby and the
reaction of any other children you might have to the baby. Your answers
will help us to understand the developing child and identify problems
that babies and their parents have.

    The questionnaire is like other questionnaires you have received. To
answer simply tick the box which best describes your baby or your
baby's situation. Some questions will seem similar but they are not the
same. Please answer all questions that you can. If you cannot answer
any question or a question does not apply to you please put a line
through them. There are no right or wrong answers. Please just describe
what happens in your situation. You may make additional comments at the
end.

 All answers are confidential.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

 FILLING IN THIS BOOKLET

Most of the questions can be answered by ticking the box beside the right answer.

For example

How many times have you been to the supermarket in the past week?

None 1 1�  2 2-63 7 or more 4

This means you went to the supermarket once in the past week

Sometimes there are questions with if in front of them.

For example

a) Have you been to the supermarket today?

Yes 1 No �  2

This means you didn't go to the supermarket and you don't
 need to answer the next question

b) If yes, did you buy any carrots?

Yes 1 No  2

In general, though, each question needs an answer.

In some questions you may be asked to describe something.
It would be helpful if you wrote as clearly as possible.

The small numbers in the squares are for only.
