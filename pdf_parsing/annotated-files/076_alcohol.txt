Assessing Alcohol Problems: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers

ALCOHOL CRAVING QUESTIONNAIRE — SHORT FORM-REVISED (ACQ—SF-R)

SCORING KEY

CONTENT VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY. The Alcohol Craving Questionnaire—Short Form (ACQ—SE-R: Singleton,
1997) contains 12-items from the 47-item Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ-NOW) developed to assess craving
for alcohol among alcohol users in the current context (right now). Items were derived from the initial validation
study (Singleton et al., 1996) of the ACQ-NOW administered to 219 subjects who had used alcohol at least once

in the last 30 days. The ACQ—SE-R contains 12 items strongly correlated with the four subscales and total ACQ
(Tiffany et al., 2000). .

Factor naming is consistent with the ACQ-NOW (Drobes et al., 1999; Potgeiter et al., 1999; Singleton et al., 1998).
The following item sets provide subscales that approximate each factor. Each item has seven compartments that are
checked-off and are scored in the fashion of 1-7 to yield an item raw score. Then perform the operation (8- reverse-
keyed item raw score = raw score) for reverse-keyed items (marked with an *). Then sum the raw scores for each factor
and divide by three (3) to yield a factor-based score. A general craving index may be derived by summing all items
(total ACQ score) and dividing by 12 (the number of items with significant loadings).

FACTOR i

Compulsivity (COMP), urges and desires in anticipation of loss of control over drinking - 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 4 (.46), 5 (.63), 6 (.51)

RELIABILITY*: .79

FACTOR 2

Expectancy (XPCT), urges and desires to drink in anticipation of the positive benefits of drinking - 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 1 (.44), 2 (.37), 12 (.43)

RELIABILITY: .77

FACTOR 3

Purposefulness (PURP), urges and desires coupled with intent and planning to drink ~ 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 3* (.57), 8* (.68), 11* (.68)

RELIABILITY: .77

FACTOR 4

Emotionality (EMOT), urges and desires to drink in anticipation of relief from withdrawal/negative affect - 3 ITEMS
ITEM NUMBER (Factor loading): 7 (.41), 9 (.47), 10 (.45)

RELIABILITY: .86

a Reliability value is estimated standardized alpha coefficient.
