2 FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE 
 

Now I am going to ask you about the foods your baby has eaten in the past 4 weeks.  I will ask you how often he/she has eaten certain foods and also 

the amount of food eaten.  You should only include food actually eaten, do not include food that was left over or spilled.  For some foods, I will show 

you drawings and models to help you estimate the amount of food.  Your baby may sometimes be fed by a relative, friend or someone else.  If you 

know the type of food and approximate amount eaten at these times please include them.  Explain the use of spoons, cups, bowl and diagrams.
