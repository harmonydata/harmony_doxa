The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) 

 

The trait MAAS is a 15-item scale designed to assess a core characteristic of mindfulness, 

namely, a receptive state of mind in which attention, informed by a sensitive awareness of what 

is occurring in the present, simply observes what is taking place.
