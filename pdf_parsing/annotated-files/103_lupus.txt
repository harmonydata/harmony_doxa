Scoring for LupusPRO v1.7 

 

 

 
 
The LupusPRO© has 5 point Likert response format, where 0=None of the time/not applicable, 1= A little of the 
time, 2= Some of the time, 3=Most of the time, 4= All of the time, 5= Not applicable (recode as 0 for scoring). 
Reverse scoring for some items is required (as above). There are 12 observed domains. Item scores are totaled for 
each domain item and the mean domain score is obtained by dividing the total score by the number of items in that 
domain. The mean raw domain score is transformed to scores ranging from 0 (worst QOL) to 100 (best QOL) by 
dividing by 4 (the number of Likert responses {5 responses} minus 1) and then multiplying by 100, as below: 
(Mean raw domain score/4) x 100= Transformed score for the domain. 
Transformed domain scores are obtainable when at least 50% of the items are answered. Total HRQOL and N-
HRQOL scores are obtained by averaging the transformed domain scores within each construct.
