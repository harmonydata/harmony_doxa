Scoring the Oswestry Disability Index

No disability
The patient can cope with most living activities. Usually no treatment is indicated apart from advice on 
lifting, sitting and exercise.

Mild disability
The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing. Travel and social life 
are more difficult and they may be disabled from work. Personal care, sexual activity and sleeping are not 
grossly affected and the patient can usually be managed by conservative means.

Moderate disability
Pain remains the main problem in this group but activities of  daily living are affected. These patients 
require a detailed investigation.

Severe disability
Back pain impinges on all aspects of  the patient’s life. Positive intervention is required.

Completely disabled
These patients are either bed-bound or are exaggerating their symptoms.

WHY BOTHER WITH AN OUTCOMES MEASURE? 
As physical therapy works towards autonomous practice and incorporating evidence-based medicine into 
it’s practice, it is imperative that therapists utilize measuring tools which have been validated through 
research.

Insurance companies and physicians are very familiar with these instruments and are asking for scores 
such as Oswestry.

The Oswestry Disability Index (aka the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is an ex-
tremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient’s permanent 
functional disability. The test has been around since 1980 and is considered the ‘gold standard’ of  low 
back pain functional outcome tools.
