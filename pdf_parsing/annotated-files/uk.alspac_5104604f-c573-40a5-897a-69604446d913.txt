questions about you and what you like and dislike, just tick a box at each question 
that is most like you.

If you love to read you would tick the end box:           

Not true     Mostly untrue  Partly true   Mostly true         True 
A11. I like reading  
 
 
If you only liked reading sometimes you would tick the middle box: 
 
    Not true      Mostly untrue   Partly true    Mostly true        True 
A11. I like reading

     <o>true</o>  <o>untrue</o> <o>true</o>  <o>true</o>
