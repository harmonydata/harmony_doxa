Male Teenager questionnaire

GROWING AND CHANGING (9)

You may have seen this type of questionnaire before.

There are important changes to a teenager's body that can

happen as early as 6 or as late as 20. At this time of life we

have some questions we need to ask and which we need to hear

about at regular intervals.

Use a BLACK or BLUE pen when you fill in the

questionnaire.

Please read carefully the instructions on page 3.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT

We would like to assess the stage of your physical development using the drawings on the

next pages. These show various stages commonly used by doctors to assess the growth and

development of boys.

We need to know which drawings most closely match

your stage of development at the moment.

Not all teenagers follow the same pattern of development.

Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.
