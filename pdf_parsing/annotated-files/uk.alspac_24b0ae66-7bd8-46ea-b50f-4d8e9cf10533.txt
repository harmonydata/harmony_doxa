Section B:    Memories of real events 
 

We are interested  in your memory for events that have happened in your life. For each 
of the following words we would like you to think of an event that happened to you 
which the word reminds you of. The event could have happened recently (e.g. 
yesterday, last week) or a long time ago. It might be an important event, or a trivial 
event. 
 

The memory you write down should be for a real event. So if we said “good” – it would 
not be OK to say “I always enjoy a good party” because this does not mention a 
specific event. But it would be OK to say “I had a good time at Jane’s party” because 
that is a real event. 
 

 Please write the real event you remember in this column. 
 

If you can’t think of an event, just leave that space blank. 
 

a)  <q>Happy</q> 
 

 
 
 

b)  <q>Bored</q> 
 

 
 
 

c)  <q>Relieved</q> 
 

 
 
 

d)  <q>Hopeless</q> 
 

 
 
 

e)  <q>Excited</q> 
 

 
 
 

f)  <q>Failure</q> 
 
 

 
 

g)  <q>Lonely</q> 
 

 
 
 

h)  <q>Sad</q> 
 

 
 
 

i)  <q>Lucky</q>
